            Our main interests are Early Years and Primary and what we can do
            about those boys underachieving. However, we may comment on
            developments we see and review anything relevant to boys and
            education.

            I will write posts, and while I do my best to keep up with research,
            I have spent most of the last 20 years working in Early Years,
            Primary and Children Centres with boys, their families and teachers
            to ensure that boys get the most from their education.
